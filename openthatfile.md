# Open *that* file
## How to be explicit with filepaths while still being portable

---

Maybe you've been here before; you are coding up a small script that needs to open a file, read the contents, and take some actions.  You put your program (`reader.py`) in the same directory as the file (`source.txt`) and code up the following:

```py
with open("source.txt", "r"): as infile:
    file_contexts = infile.read()

print(infile)
```

Here you tell Python to `open` the file `source.txt` and you don't give any type of filepath to the file because it's right there, in the same place as your program `reader.py`.  So you hit `Run` in your editor of choice and...

```py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'source.txt'
```

What?

Now we're sure the `reader.py` and the `source.txt` are together in a folder named `project`.  It looks like this:

```
C
└── Users
    └── preocts
        └── Documents
            └── project
                ├── reader.py
                └── source.txt
```

So, `reader.py` should totally be able to see `source.txt` and open it. Right? Well, if we add a few lines of code we see the cause of our issue.

```py
import pathlib

print(pathlib.Path().cwd())
print(pathlib.Path(__file__))

with open("source.txt", "r"): as infile:
    file_contexts = infile.read()

print(infile)
```

```py
C:\Users\preocts
C:\Users\preocts\Documents\project\reader.py

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'source.txt'
```

We import `pathlib` which is a great standard library for working with filepaths. The first print is showing us what is called the "current working directory".  This is where the Python interpreter was run.

The second print is telling us where the `reader.py` is. `__file__` is a special value set by Python which holds the location of the file.

Notice our paths here do not match! Python isn't "working" where our file is located. We can think of that current working directory as a "You are here" arrow on a map of our file system.  That's where the interpreter is and, unless told otherwise, where the interpreter starts to look for files.

This is a common issue for anyone that uses the built-in terminal of their editors to run the code.  Unless told otherwise, many editors default to the user's home directory as the current working directory.

So when we used `open("source.txt")...` we assumed the interpreter would look in the same path as the `reader.py` (at least, I did at first). Instead, python is looking for the file at `C:\Users\preocts\source.txt`.

### The Python interpreter's current working directory is set where the interpreter is run. This will effect where Python looks for files with the `open` statement (and imports too).

So that's what is wrong with our program. We're just looking for our file in the wrong place. Now, we just need a solution.

A fast and easy solution would be to use an absolute path to open our file. Using `C:\Users\preocts\Documents\project\reader.py` would get the job done, but it's not very portable. The code wouldn't work on anyone else's computer or if we moved the files. Great for local-only projects.

Another solution would be to configure the editor to use the `.\project` directory as the working directory. This can be a good habit for development but if you shared the project, the next dev might have the same issue. Again, portability is lost.

Instead, we can leverage that special `__file__` value and open `source.txt` *relative to the location of* `reader.py`. Meaning that so long as we know where `source.txt` is in relation to `reader.py` we will be able to find and open it. To do this, we'll, again, use `pathlib`.

```py
filepath = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / "source.txt"
```

This looks complex if you aren't familiar with `pathlib` but it is actually very straight-forward.

- `pathlib.Path(__file__)` gives us the full path to our file: `C:\Users\preocts\Documents\project\reader.py`
- `.parent` removes the right-most piece of the path, leaving us with just a location: `C:\Users\preocts\Documents\project`
- `/ "source.txt` is how we add to a `Path` object.
- Together we get `C:\Users\preocts\Documents\project\source.txt` which is the absolute path of our target file.

The neat thing is that if we move `reader.py` the code will still work so long as we move `source.txt` with it.

Our end code looks like this:

```py
import pathlib

filepath = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / "source.txt"

with open(filepath, "r"): as infile:
    file_contexts = infile.read()

print(infile)
```

With an expected output of our file without needing to worry about where the Python interpreter is running (working directory).

```
Eggs are amazing.
