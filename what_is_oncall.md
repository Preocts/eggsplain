Open transparency at the beginning of this write-up; I enjoy being on-call. Perhaps there is something wrong with me. However, I think there is something wrong with the perception of on-call duty and the expectations we put around it.  So my opinions here will come out as biased and even a little more than optimistic.  Take that as you will.

What is being on-call?  The term is used in many different fields.  Even so, the meaning of the term and the role can be distilled down to a few key responsibilities.  Mindfully, we know these responsibilities change given the professional field, team, environment, and even person who holds them. Still, let me try my best to summarize this into something that contains the flavor but without the bulk of the body.

Being on-call, or having an on-call shift, is a period of time in which you have little to no predictability in your work-flow.  The unpredicted and unexpected events are your responsibility for the entire duration of the shift.  If it is 02:00 in the morning and an emergency happens, it is your phone ringing and your job to answer the call.  To use a metaphor; picture a desk with a red phone on it.  You have no idea if it will ring or when but your job, for the duration of the shift, is to answer that phone if it does ring.

Now with that simplified summary there are usually a few terrifying situations and questions that creep into someone's mind.  What happens if I miss the phone?  What if I can't understand who calls?  What if I don't know what to do?  The list of questions and worse-case scenarios just grows with time, usually.

To tackle some of these concerns let us address a few things that on-call is not. Being the one answering the phone, being on-call, is not the only hope for your job, company, or humanity to continue existence. There should always be, and almost always is, someone else that will get called.  You aren't the only person, you are just the first person.  No teams of one survive long and if it is important enough to call you at 02:00 in the morning it will be important enough to call "the next person".

In addition, you are not usually expected to be the solution to the problem that is ringing the phone.  You are the catalyst to start the solutioning process.  You are not expected to know everything about anything that call has to ask.  That would be nearly impossible, having an expect to anything on-call all the time.  Now, a lot of the time you might be just the person needed.  Having the access to a resource needed, the documents to a question being asked, or just knowing how to solve the problem.  That's great, but it's not the expectation and it is important to remember that.

To reiterate; you are on-call because someone needs to answer the phone.  It is proven to be faster to call a single point of contact, the red phone in this case, during an emergency than to call the expert.  Valuable time is lost as the caller freezes in analysis paralysis on who to call if there are many choices.  Instead, one contact remove the choice of who to call and focuses the choice on "is this an emergency?"

talking points:
- on-call is chosen for being responsible 
  - not everyone can be on-call
  - it should be a sign of trust not punishment
